# My Website AWS Deployment

Deploy my website (www.sergeypetrunin.com) to AWS via CloudFormation

Templates adapted from:
https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-cloudfront-secure-static-site
It appears that Lambda is no longer needed, removed.

Deploy is performed by copying templates and files to S3 buckets.
